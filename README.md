### Overview

This project aims to predict dengue virus outbreaks using machine learning techniques. 

In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms and historical dengue data to forecast dengue outbreaks. We use a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict dengue cases in specific regions or areas. The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. The project also includes visualization and analysis of the predicted results to gain insights into the patterns and trends of dengue outbreaks.

The code provided in this repository allows users to easily run the dengue virus prediction models, analyze the results, and make informed decisions for disease control and prevention. The project has potential applications in resource allocation, disease control, public health messaging, economic impact assessment, risk assessment, and insurance planning.







### Business Understanding

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses a significant public health challenge in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. The rapid spread of the disease and its impact on healthcare resources, economic productivity, and public health make it a pressing concern for governments, healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders.

The main business problems related to dengue virus outbreaks that this project aims to address are:

Resource allocation: During dengue outbreaks, healthcare resources can be strained, including hospital beds, medical personnel, and supplies. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks can help allocate resources effectively to areas at higher risk, ensuring that adequate resources are available to manage the increased demand.
Disease control and prevention: Controlling mosquito populations, which transmit the dengue virus, is a critical strategy for preventing dengue virus transmission. Predicting dengue outbreaks can inform targeted mosquito control measures in high-risk areas, reducing the spread of the virus and preventing outbreaks.
Public health messaging and education: Timely and targeted public health messaging and education campaigns can help raise awareness among the public, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders about the risks of dengue and the importance of preventive measures. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks can enable effective public health messaging and education efforts.
Economic impact: Dengue outbreaks can have significant economic consequences, including increased healthcare costs, lost productivity due to illness, and decreased tourism in affected areas. Predicting dengue outbreaks can help businesses and policymakers plan and implement appropriate measures to mitigate the economic impact.
Risk assessment and insurance planning: Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks can assist insurance companies in assessing the risk of dengue-related claims and developing appropriate insurance products. It can also help individuals, businesses, and governments in planning for insurance coverage, risk management, and financial preparedness in areas prone to dengue outbreaks.
By addressing these business problems, this project aims to contribute to effective dengue virus control and prevention efforts, improve resource allocation, raise public awareness, and mitigate the impact of dengue outbreaks on public health and the economy.


### Project Overview

This project was created to help the people in San Juan and Iquitos to get prepared for dengue virus outbreaks and to help government agencies to allocate resources.
In this project, using the data from 1990 to 2010, I was able to create a predictive model with very minimal error, 6 cases per week for San Juan and 4 cases per week for Iquitos.
