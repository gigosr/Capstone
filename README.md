Overview

This project aims to predict dengue virus outbreaks using machine learning techniques. Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that poses a significant public health challenge in many tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Accurate prediction of dengue outbreaks can help healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders effectively plan and implement preventive measures, allocate resources, and mitigate the impact of the disease.

In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms and historical dengue data to forecast dengue outbreaks. We use a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning models to predict dengue cases in specific regions or areas. The models are trained on historical data and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics. The project also includes visualization and analysis of the predicted results to gain insights into the patterns and trends of dengue outbreaks.

The code provided in this repository allows users to easily run the dengue virus prediction models, analyze the results, and make informed decisions for disease control and prevention. The project has potential applications in resource allocation, disease control, public health messaging, economic impact assessment, risk assessment, and insurance planning.
